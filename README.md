RSpec Basics

Let's learn the basics of RSpec by implementing part of a string calculator:

Create a simple string calculator with a method int Add(string numbers)

The method can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers, and will return their sum (for an empty string it will return 0) for example “” or “1” or “1,2”

Allow the Add method to handle an unknown amount of numbers.
